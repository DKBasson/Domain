<h1>Domain Selection</h1>

<p>At CPUT, the student attendance is recorded mostly on paper. This method is outdated and flawed. Any student can sign another student as present. Also, the outdated paper system creates an annoying amount of admin for the specific lecturer. So, with this problem in mind, I have decided to create a Student Attendance Management System to make it easier for lecturers to identify which students have a perfect attendance record and which students have been bunking most of the time. This system should also reduce the lecturerâ€™s admin in regards with attendance to virtually zero. The domain I have selected will be StudentManagement and the sub domain that will manage attendance will be called StudentAttendanceManagementSystem. The end goal for this project is to create software that makes the attendance sign in process easier and to reduce the lecturers admin.</p>
