<h1>Domain Selection</h1>

<p>At CPUT, the student attendance is recorded mostly on paper. This method is outdated and flawed. Any student can sign another student as present. Also, the outdated paper system creates an annoying amount of admin for the specific lecturer. So, with this problem in mind, I have decided to create a Student Attendance Management System to make it easier for lecturers to identify which students have a perfect attendance record and which students have been bunking most of the time. This system should also reduce the lecturerâ€™s admin in regards with attendance to virtually zero. The domain I have selected will be StudentManagement and the sub domain that will manage attendance will be called StudentAttendanceManagementSystem. The end goal for this project is to create software that makes the attendance sign in process easier and to reduce the lecturers admin.</p>

<h1>General Flow</h1>
<p> Students can use this system to sign themselves into class. A Student can either be Added or Removed by the Administrator. Once added, a Student can sign in for there specific lecture that they are currently attending. The Lecturers ID, the Venues number, the Students ID and the Subject code will be recorded into the Attendance class. if a Student has bunked more than a certain amount of days, than he/she will either be suspended or Expelled. The Attendance of the student will also be sent to the Students sponsor, Business Sponsor or Parent. The attendane will also be reviewed by the HOD and the specific Lecturer. There is also multiple types of Students. There is the Associate Degree Students, the Bachelor's Degree Students, the Master Degree Students and the Doctoral Degree Students. For each type of student, there is a specific type of punishment if the studentb has bunked enough classes.  </p>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<li>Any IDE preferably IntelliJ IDEA</li>
<li>junit 4.11</li>
<li>Maven</li></p>
